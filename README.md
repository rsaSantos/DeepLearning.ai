# DeepLearning.ai

Compilation of projects related to the DeepLearning.ai specialization available at https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning.

The third course of the specialization ((3) Structuring Machine Learning Projects) does not contain any programming assignment and is therefore not displayed here.

There are some big files (>100MB) that I couldn't upload "normally" here. I have splitted the respective files and added a README.me file to explain how to get the original big files back. This files are usually data and are necessary to run the jupyter notebooks.
