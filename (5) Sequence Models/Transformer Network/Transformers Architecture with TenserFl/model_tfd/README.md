Since the file at Transformers Architecture with TenserFl/model_tfd/fa107dc22c014df078a1b75235144a927f7e9764916222711f239b7ee6092ec9.bc4b731be56d8422e12b1d5bfa86fbd81d18d2770da1f5ac4f33640a17b7dde9.h5 is larger than 100MB, I can't really upload it to github.

I will split the files with the command: "split -b 45M "fa107dc22c014df078a1b75235144a927f7e9764916222711f239b7ee6092ec9.bc4b731be56d8422e12b1d5bfa86fbd81d18d2770da1f5ac4f33640a17b7dde9.h5" "parts-prefix""
To join the files, in order to run the jupyter notebook use the following command: "cat parts-prefix* > "fa107dc22c014df078a1b75235144a927f7e9764916222711f239b7ee6092ec9.bc4b731be56d8422e12b1d5bfa86fbd81d18d2770da1f5ac4f33640a17b7dde9.h5""
